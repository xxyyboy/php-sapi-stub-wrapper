The STUB (stand alone applications wrapper) SAPI has been introduced
with a goal of making PHP better at supporting the creation of 
stand alone applications.

Install instruction:
Download and extract into php source $(PHP_SRC)/sapi/stub, rename folder if needed.
In command line put:
cd $(PHP_SRC)
then:
buildconf --force
next enable build stub wrapper:
*nixes:
./configure --enable-stub-wrapper 
Windows:
configure --enable-stub
and 
make

Copy or move stub(.exe) in folder app, put app.php in assets folder in program directory. 
Under OSX put in $(APP).app/Contents/MacOS/stub and app.php place in $(APP).app/Contents/Resources/assets.
Php extensions copy too in $(PROGRAM)/ext folder on unixes, on Windows extensions is in application directory.

Build portable GUI apps with wxphp.
